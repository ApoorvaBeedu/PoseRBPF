```

## Installation 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XinkeAE/PoseRBPF.git --recursive
```

Install dependencies:
- install anaconda according to [the official website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
- create the virtual env with ```pose_rbpf_env.yml```:
```angular2html
conda env create -f pose_rbpf_env.yml
conda activate pose_rbpf_env
``` 
- compile the YCB Renderer according to the [instruction](./ycb_render/README.md).
- compile the utility functions with:
```angular2html
sh build.sh
```

## A quick demo on the YCB Video Dataset 
- The demo shows tracking ```003_cracker_box``` on YCB Video Dataset.
- Run script ```download_demo.sh``` to download checkpoint (434 MB), CAD models (743 MB), 2D detections (13 MB), and necessary data (3 GB) for the demo:
```angular2html
sh scripts/download_demo.sh
```
- Then you should have files organized like:
```angular2html
├── ...
├── PoseRBPF
|   |── cad_models
|   |   |── ycb_models
|   |   └── ...
|   |── checkpoints
|   |   |── ycb_ckpts_roi_rgbd
|   |   |── ycb_codebooks_roi_rgbd
|   |   |── ycb_configs_roi_rgbd
|   |   └── ... 
|   |── detections
|   |   |── posecnn_detections
|   |   |── tless_retina_detections 
|   |── config                      # configuration files for training and DPF
|   |── networks                    # auto-encoder networks
|   |── pose_rbpf                   # particle filters
|   └── ...
|── YCB_Video_Dataset               # to store ycb data
|   |── cameras  
|   |── data 
|   |── image_sets 
|   |── keyframes 
|   |── poses               
|   └── ...           
└── ...
```

- Run demo with ```003_cracker_box```. The results will be stored in ```./results/```
```angular2html
./scripts/run_demo.sh;
```

## Testing on the YCB Video Dataset
- Download checkpoints from [the google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oBJvabEbuCN-AXQwxGEE5UDOaYAqZvp_?usp=sharing) (```ycb_rgbd.tar.gz``` or ```ycb_rgb.tar.gz```) and unzip to the checkpoint directory.
- Download all the data in the [YCB Video Dataset](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/projects/posecnn/) so the ```../YCB_Video_Dataset/data``` folder contains all the sequences.
- Run RGB-D tracking (use ```002_master_chef_can``` as an example here):
```angular2html
sh scripts/test_ycb_rgbd/val_ycb_002_rgbd.sh 0 1;
```
- Run RGB tracking (use ```002_master_chef_can``` as an example here):
```angular2html
sh scripts/test_ycb_rgb/val_ycb_002_rgb.sh 0 1;
```
