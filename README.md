```

## Installation 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XinkeAE/PoseRBPF.git --recursive
```

Install dependencies:
- install anaconda according to [the official website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
- create the virtual env with ```pose_rbpf_env.yml```:
```angular2html
conda env create -f pose_rbpf_env.yml
conda activate pose_rbpf_env
``` 
- compile the YCB Renderer according to the [instruction](./ycb_render/README.md).
- compile the utility functions with:
```angular2html
sh build.sh
```

## A quick demo on the YCB Video Dataset 
- The demo shows tracking ```003_cracker_box``` on YCB Video Dataset.
- Run script ```download_demo.sh``` to download checkpoint (434 MB), CAD models (743 MB), 2D detections (13 MB), and necessary data (3 GB) for the demo:
```angular2html
./scripts/download_demo.sh
```
- Then you should have files organized like:
```angular2html
├── ...
├── PoseRBPF
|   |── cad_models
|   |   |── ycb_models
|   |   └── ...
|   |── checkpoints
|   |   |── ycb_ckpts_roi_rgbd
|   |   |── ycb_codebooks_roi_rgbd
|   |   |── ycb_configs_roi_rgbd
|   |   └── ... 
|   |── detections
|   |   |── posecnn_detections
|   |   |── tless_retina_detections 
|   |── config                      # configuration files for training and DPF
|   |── networks                    # auto-encoder networks
|   |── pose_rbpf                   # particle filters
|   └── ...
|── YCB_Video_Dataset               # to store ycb data
|   |── cameras  
|   |── data 
|   |── image_sets 
|   |── keyframes 
|   |── poses               
|   └── ...           
└── ...
```

- Run demo with ```003_cracker_box```. The results will be stored in ```./results/```
```angular2html
./scripts/run_demo.sh
```

## Online Real-world Pose Estimation using ROS
- Due to the incompatibility between ROS Kinetic and Python 3, the ROS node only runs with Python 2.7. We first create the virtual env with ```pose_rbpf_env_py2.yml```:
```angular2html
conda env create -f pose_rbpf_env_py2.yml
conda activate pose_rbpf_env_py2
```
- compile the YCB Renderer according to the [instruction](./ycb_render/README.md).
- compile the utility functions with:
```angular2html
sh build.sh
```
- Make sure you can run the demo above first.
- Install ROS if it's not there:
```angular2html
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
```

- Update python packages:
```angular2html
conda install -c auto catkin_pkg
pip install -U rosdep rosinstall_generator wstool rosinstall six vcstools
pip install msgpack
pip install empy
```

- Source ROS (every time before launching the node):
```angular2html
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
```

- Initialze rosdep:
```angular2html
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

### Single object tracking demo:
- Download demo rosbag:
```angular2html
./scripts/download_ros_demo.sh
```

- Run PoseCNN node (with roscore running in another terminal):
```angular2html
./scripts/run_ros_demo_posecnn.sh
```

- Run PoseRBPF node (with roscore running in another terminal):
```angular2html
./scripts/run_ros_demo.sh
```

- Run RVIZ in the PoseRBPF directory:
```angular2html
rosrun rviz rviz -d ./ros/tracking.rviz
```

- Once you see ```*** PoseRBPF Ready ...``` in the PoseRBPF terminal, run rosbag in another terminal, then you should be able to see the tracking demo:
```angular2html
rosbag play ./ros_data/demo_single.bag
```

### Multiple object tracking demo:
- Download demo rosbag:
```angular2html
./scripts/download_ros_demo_multiple.sh
```

- Download additional checkpoints from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19V75k5QzczyXIE9bu-WJJoqJUpAVy1G0/view?usp=sharing) and add to ```./checkpoints/```

- Run PoseCNN node (with roscore running in another terminal):
```angular2html
./scripts/run_ros_demo_posecnn.sh
```

- Run PoseRBPF node (with roscore running in another terminal):
```angular2html
./scripts/run_ros_demo_multiple.sh
```

- Run RVIZ in the PoseRBPF directory:
```angular2html
rosrun rviz rviz -d ./ros/tracking.rviz
```

- Once you see ```*** PoseRBPF Ready ...``` in the PoseRBPF terminal, run rosbag in another terminal, then you should be able to see the tracking demo:
```angular2html
rosbag play ./ros_data/demo_multiple.bag
```

## Testing on the YCB Video Dataset
- Download checkpoints from [the google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mkW9RSgXHKnYmSJIKEI3pjaNgc_IKpgD?usp=sharing) (```ycb_rgbd_full.tar.gz``` or ```ycb_rgb_full.tar.gz```) and unzip to the checkpoint directory.
- Download all the data in the [YCB Video Dataset](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/projects/posecnn/) so the ```../YCB_Video_Dataset/data``` folder contains all the sequences.
- Run RGB-D tracking (use ```002_master_chef_can``` as an example here):
```angular2html
sh scripts/test_ycb_rgbd/val_ycb_002_rgbd.sh 0 1
```
- Run RGB tracking (use ```002_master_chef_can``` as an example here):
```angular2html
sh scripts/test_ycb_rgb/val_ycb_002_rgb.sh 0 1
```

## Testing on the T-LESS Dataset
- Download checkpoints from [the google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mkW9RSgXHKnYmSJIKEI3pjaNgc_IKpgD?usp=sharing) (```tless_rgbd_full.tar.gz``` or ```tless_rgb_full.tar.gz```) and unzip to the checkpoint directory.
- Download all the data in the [T-LESS Dataset](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/t-less/download.html) so the ```../TLess/``` folder contains all the sequences.
- Download all the models for T-LESS objects from [the google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15rCCI_hgsjei3zlvbF05HUzoYm2uP2fE/view?usp=sharing).

```
- Run RGB-D tracking (use ```obj_01``` as an example here):
```angular2html
sh scripts/test_tless_rgbd/val_tless_01_rgbd.sh 0 1
```
- Run RGB tracking (use ```obj_01``` as an example here):
```angular2html

```

## Training
- Download microsoft coco dataset 2017 val images from [here](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip) for data augmentation.
- Store the folder ```val2017``` in ```../coco/```
- Run training example for ```002_master_chef_can``` in the YCB objects. The training should be able to run on one single NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPU:
```angular2html
sh scripts/train_ycb_rgbd/train_script_ycb_002.sh
```
